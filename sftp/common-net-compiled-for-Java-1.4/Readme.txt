Common-net compiled/modified for Java 1.4.

The test Java Classes 
are only files to debug a sftp conection. 
It was used to test if the compiled common-net was working
for our proyect.
Nothing special and kind of ugly code. 
But I usually use these kind of classes to test libraries in an informal way
before using them in development
